# SMA-EM daemon features (without maintenance)

this page should give an overview of available features.
I could not test all features, because I do not have the appropriate hardware / software.

All the desired features must be activated in the configuration file
```
[SMA-EM]
# list of features to load/run
features=simplefswriter nextfeature
```
Each feature has it own configuration section  in the configuration-file.

[FEATURE-featurename]

please have a look at the config.sample file or have a look at the features file (description) for supported configuration options.

```
[FEATURE-simplefswriter]
# list serials simplefswriter notice
serials=1900204522
# measurement vars simplefswriter should write to filesystem (only from smas with serial in serials)
values=pconsume psupply qsupply ssupply
